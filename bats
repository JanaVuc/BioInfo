Syconycteris australis is closely related to Pteropus lylei.
It could be useful because of the possibility of them being vectors or hosts for viruses and the possibility of studying them and their immunity is important. By studying the phylogenetic relationships between these species, we can better understand how diseases move between animals and humans and develop strategies for disease prevention and control that consider both animal and human health. It could be useful as well for conservation efforts.
